# AI-Enhanced Selenium Automation

## Overview

This repository demonstrates Selenium automation enhanced with machine learning (Random Forest) to handle dynamic web elements. The AI model helps locate elements even when their XPaths change.

## Key Features

- **Traditional Selenium Example**: See `selenium.py` for basic automation
- **AI-Powered Element Location**: Random Forest model for dynamic XPath handling

- `selenium.py`: Basic Selenium implementation (reference)
  - `rf.py`: Random Forest implementation
  - `model.py`: Self Healing and Feature extraction
